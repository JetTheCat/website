So apparently the run build script failed on netlify because some random installation
into the node_module package corrupted the build. Hence if you/myself ever face this issue 
again delete node modules and do a "npm install" and "npm install react-router-dom" again
cause I spent hours fixing a dumbshit issue that only took a minute to fix.
